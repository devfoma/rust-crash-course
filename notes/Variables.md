Understanding Variables in Rust
Welcome to this lesson on variables in the Rust programming language. We'll explore how Rust handles variables, including their mutability, how types are determined, the concept of shadowing, the use of constants, and various methods for printing variable values to the console.

Variables and Mutability in Rust
One of the core safety features of Rust is its handling of variable mutability.

Default Immutability
By default, variables in Rust are immutable. This means that once a value is bound to a variable name, you cannot change that value. Attempting to reassign an immutable variable will result in a compile-time error.

Consider this example:

// let x = 1;
// x = 2; // Error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
If you were to uncomment and compile this code, the Rust compiler would prevent you from changing the value of x.

Enabling Mutability with mut
To declare a variable that can be changed, you must explicitly use the mut keyword before the variable name during its declaration.

Let's look at how to make a variable mutable:

`fn main() {
    // Variables
    // - Immutable by default
    // - Use mut keyword to make it mutable
    let mut x = 1; // x is declared as mutable
    println!("The initial value of x is: {}", x);
    x += 1;        // The value of x can be changed
    println!("The new value of x is: {}", x); // Now x is 2
}`

In this snippet, x is declared as mutable using let mut x = 1;. We can then successfully change its value, for instance, by incrementing it. This explicit approach to mutability is a key difference from many other programming languages where variables are often mutable by default.

Type Inference
Rust is a statically-typed language. This means that the type of every variable must be known by the compiler at compile time. However, Rust also features powerful type inference. In many cases, you don't need to explicitly state the type of a variable because the compiler can infer it from the value assigned and how it's used.

Default Integer Type
When you assign an integer value without specifying a type, Rust defaults to i32 (a 32-bit signed integer).

Observe the following declarations:

`fn main() {
    // Type inference
    let y: i32 = -1; // Explicitly typed as i32
    let z = -1;       // Type is inferred by Rust as i32
​
    println!("y is: {}, z is: {}", y, z);
    // These two lines of code are essentially the same in terms of the resulting type for z.
}`

Here, y is explicitly annotated as an i32. For z, no type is specified, so Rust infers it as i32 because -1 is an integer literal.

Shadowing
Rust allows you to declare a new variable with the same name as a previously declared variable. This concept is known as "shadowing." The new variable "shadows" the previous one, meaning any subsequent use of that variable name will refer to the new variable until it goes out of scope or is shadowed again.

Shadowing is distinct from marking a variable as mut:

When you shadow a variable, you are effectively creating an entirely new variable. The previous variable still exists but is no longer accessible by that name in the current scope.

Crucially, shadowing allows you to change the type of the variable, which is not possible with mut. A mutable variable can change its value, but not its type.

Here's an example demonstrating shadowing, including a type change:

`fn main() {
    // Shadowing
    let x: i32 = 1;
    println!("x is: {}", x); // x is 1 (i32)
​
    let x: i32 = 2;    // x is shadowed. It's now a new variable also named x, with value 2 (i32)
    println!("x is now: {}", x);
​
    let x: bool = true; // x is shadowed again. It's now a new variable of type bool with value true
    println!("x is finally: {}", x); // x is true (bool)
}`

In this code, x is first an i32 with value 1, then shadowed by another i32 with value 2, and finally shadowed by a bool with value true.

Type Placeholder for Inference
In some situations, particularly with more complex types or generic programming, the Rust compiler might require a type annotation, but you might want Rust to infer the specific type. For this, you can use an underscore _ as a type placeholder. This tells the compiler, "I know a type is needed here, please figure it out."

`
fn main() {
    // Type placeholder
    let x: _ = 1234; // Rust will infer the type (i32 in this case)
    println!("x with type placeholder is: {}", x);
}`

This can be handy when a type is verbose or obvious from the context, allowing you to let the compiler do the work. For 1234, Rust infers i32.

Constants
Constants are values that are bound to a name and are guaranteed not to change. They differ from immutable variables in several key ways.

Declaration: Constants are declared using the const keyword instead of let.

Type Annotation: The type of a constant must always be explicitly annotated.

Scope: Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope (outside of any function).

Naming Convention: By convention, constant names are written in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_POINTS).

Value: The value of a constant must be a constant expression, meaning it must be determinable at compile time. It cannot be the result of a function call or anything else computed at runtime.

Here's an example of a constant:

// This can be outside fn main()
// // Constants
const NUM: u32 = 1; // NUM is a constant of type u32 with value 1
​
`fn main() {
    println!("The constant NUM is: {}", NUM);
}`

Key Differences Between Constants (const) and Immutable Variables (let):

Immutable variables declared with let are still variables. Their value is set at runtime (when the let statement is executed) and stored in memory. Even though they can't be changed after initialization, they behave like runtime values.

Constants declared with const are not just immutable; their values are effectively inlined into the compiled code wherever they are used. They are resolved at compile time. You cannot use mut with const.

Printing Variables with the println! Macro
Rust provides the versatile println! macro for printing text and variable values to the console. It uses a format string as its first argument, followed by any values to be interpolated.

Here are several ways to use println!:

1. Basic Placeholders
Use empty curly braces {} as placeholders in the format string. The variables to be printed are passed as subsequent arguments to println!, and they fill the placeholders in order.

`fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    let name = "Alice";
    println!("x is {}, and name is {}", x, name); // Output: x is 1, and name is Alice
}
`
2. Inline Variable Names (Rust 2021+ Edition)
You can directly include the variable name within the curly braces. This can make the println! statement more readable, especially when printing many variables.

`fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    let y = 10;
    // Inline
    println!("x is {x} and y is {y}"); // Output: x is 1 and y is 10
}
`
3. Positional Arguments
You can use numbers inside the curly braces (e.g., {0}, {1}) to refer to the arguments passed to println! by their position (0-indexed). This allows you to reuse arguments or change their order in the output.

`fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    // Positional arguments
    println!("{0} + {0} = {1}", x, x + x); // Output: 1 + 1 = 2
    println!("The second argument is {1}, the first is {0}", x, x + x); // Output: The second argument is 2, the first is 1
}`

Here, {0} refers to the first argument after the format string (x), and {1} refers to the second argument (x + x).

4. Debug Printing
For more detailed output, especially for complex types (like structs or enums) or when debugging, you can use the debug formatting specifier:

{:?}: This requests a debug representation of the variable.

{:#?}: This requests a "pretty" debug print, which formats the output in a more human-readable way, often with indentation and newlines for complex structures.

`fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    let point = (10, 20); // A tuple
​
    // Debug
    println!("DEBUG simple: x is {:?}", x);    // Output: DEBUG simple: x is 1
    println!("DEBUG pretty simple: x is {:#?}", x);   // Output: DEBUG pretty simple: x is 1 (for simple types, similar to :?)
​
    println!("DEBUG tuple: point is {:?}", point); // Output: DEBUG tuple: point is (10, 20)
    println!("DEBUG pretty tuple: point is {:#?}", point);
    // Output for pretty tuple:
    // DEBUG pretty tuple: point is (
    //     10,
    //     20,
    // )
}`

Debug printing is incredibly useful for inspecting the state of your data. Most standard library types and types you define (if you derive Debug) can be printed this way.

This lesson covered the fundamentals of variables in Rust: their default immutability, the mut keyword, type inference, shadowing, constants, and various ways to print them using println!. These concepts are foundational to writing any Rust program.
